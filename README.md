# ExploreCode
## Description
ExploreCode is a repository dedicated to implementing an advanced code interrogation system powered by LangChain. Our goal is to enhance understanding and improve analysis of complex codebases by utilizing state-of-the-art language models and vector storage systems. This repository will house a system capable of responding efficiently to user queries about the codebase, helping developers and analysts navigate and understand the code more effectively.

## Coming Soon
In the future, this repository will contain:

1. Preparation Tools: Scripts and instructions for preparing your codebase for analysis, including chunking and embedding.
2. Interrogation System: The main LangChain implementation that allows you to ask questions about your codebase and get answers based on the code's content.
3. Deep Lake Integration: Techniques for storing and retrieving vectorized code chunks using the Deep Lake vector storage system.
4. Guides & Tutorials: Comprehensive guides and tutorials on how to use the provided tools and how to get the most out of your code interrogation system.
5. Example Codebases: Sample codebases and corresponding interrogation results for you to learn from and experiment with.
